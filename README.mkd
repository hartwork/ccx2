Known issues
------------
There's a bug in XMMS2 0.5 that makes adding songs to the playlist appear in
reversed order, this is fixed in the XMMS2 0.6 DrM development version.

There's some sort of race condition going on in the search, so sometimes when
searching by means of the :search or :same commands might not show any results
even though there should be. Restarting ccx2 is the only solution for now.
Looking into it.

Adding a playlist to the current one works, but the current playlist isn't
refreshed correctly.

Testing was mostly done with python 2.6 and XMMS2 0.6, there may be unforseen
bugs when used with previous versions of these applications.
